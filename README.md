Here's a **README.md** file for your **Nine-Slice Trimmer** Unity Editor tool. It provides an overview, installation steps, and usage instructions.

### **📜 Nine-Slice Trimmer**  

A Unity Editor tool that trims the center slice of a **9-Slice Sprite** while preserving the outer edges. This reduces texture size while keeping the sprite's slicing functionality.  

---

## **📌 Features**  
✅ **Trim 9-Slice Sprites** – Removes the central portion while keeping the outer edges.  
✅ **Preview Before Saving** – See how the trimmed sprite looks before saving.  
✅ **Handles Vertical & Horizontal Slice-Only Cases** – Works even if only one axis is sliced.  
✅ **Easy & Modern UI** – Simple, clean, and efficient interface.

## **🛠 Installation**  
1. **Download the script**  
   Copy the `NineSliceTrimmer.cs` file into your Unity project's `Editor` folder.  

2. **Refresh the Asset Database**  
   Go to **Unity Editor → Assets → Reimport All** (if needed).

## **🚀 How to Use**  
1. **Open the Tool**  
   - Go to **Unity Editor** → **Tools** → **Nine-Slice Trimmer**.  

2. **Select a Sprite**  
   - Drag & drop a **9-Slice sprite** (with a border) into the tool.  

3. **Preview (Optional)**  
   - Click **👁 Preview** to see how the trimmed sprite will look.  

4. **Trim & Save**  
   - Click **✂ Trim & Save** to trim the sprite and replace the original asset.  
   - The tool updates the sprite’s slicing settings automatically.

## **⚠️ Notes**  
- Works only with **single sprites** (not sprite atlases).  
- Does not affect the original texture size in the import settings—only removes the unnecessary center part.  
- For **horizontal or vertical-only slicing**, it trims only the necessary axis.
